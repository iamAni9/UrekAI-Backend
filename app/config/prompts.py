        Follow these strict rules:

        Step 1: Column Naming
        - Use column names from the sample rows if provided.
        - If names are missing or contain typos (e.g., 'em#il'), correct them based on context.
        - If a column has no name or is named NULL, infer a meaningful name based on the data in that column.
        - "Ensure unique column names. If duplicates exist, append numeric suffixes (e.g., 'name_1', 'name_2').
        - Preserve the original column order.

        Step 2: Column Typing
        - Infer the PostgreSQL data type of each column using sample values.
        - For date/time values, use the accurate type from the provided list of PostgreSQL formats: {DATA_TIME_FORMAT.join(', ')}
        - For formatted numbers (e.g., '17,50,000', '$1,234.56'), use TEXT data type to preserve formatting.

        Step 3: Column Insights
        - Provide a brief insight or summary for each column to explain its content or business relevance.
        - If all sample values in a column are NULL, preserve it as NULL in the schema.

        Step 4: Metadata
        - Add a key 'contains_column' with value 'YES' if column headers are present in the sample, otherwise 'NO'.

        Output Constraints:
        - Response Requirements: Output valid JSON only. No markdown formatting, comments, or explanatory text outside the JSON structure.
        - DOUBLE-QUOTE all string values and keys.
        - DO NOT include comments inside the JSON.
        - Strict: Ensure the number of columns in the output exactly matches the `Number of Columns` provided."

SQL_GENERATION_PROMPT = {
    "systemPrompt": '''
        You are an expert in PostgreSQL query generation. Your task is to generate 4 distinct PostgreSQL queries based on a user’s analytical question and structured table metadata.

        Follow these core rules:

        General SQL Rules:
        1. Generate only **PostgreSQL**, not SQLite syntax.
        2. Query Strategy: Before generating SQL, decompose the user question into: (1) Required data elements, (2) Necessary calculations, (3) Expected output format. This ensures comprehensive coverage of the analytical need.
        3. Always use the **exact table and column names** from metadata — preserve spaces and case using double quotes.
        4. Typecast all columns appropriately — all data is stored as TEXT in the database.
        5. Round numeric outputs to 2 decimal places.
        6. Apply LIMIT 100 to non-aggregate queries for performance optimization (unless specified otherwise).
        7. Write independent queries per table. Each query should focus on a single table's data. Cross-table relationships will be handled through post-processing of individual query results.
        8. NULLs in aggregates (e.g., AVG, SUM) should be handled gracefully (e.g., automatically ignored unless user asks otherwise).
        9. Use GROUP BY and ORDER BY where logically applicable.
        10. Always ensure syntax is valid and queries are performance-optimized.

        Classification-Specific Rule:
        If classification type is 'data_with_chart', suggest a suitable chart type for at least one query.

        Return format:
        [
            {
                "query": "<SQL QUERY>",
                "explanation": "<Brief explanation of what this query answers>"

    "userPrompt": '''
        You are provided with structured metadata for one or more PostgreSQL tables. Your task is to analyze the user's question and generate 4 insightful queries.

        Step-by-step:

        1. **Understand the user question**: Identify the intent, filters, comparisons, and expected outputs.
        2. **Analyze the metadata**:
        - Use the exact `table_name` and column names.
        - Check schema to infer column types (since all data is TEXT).
        - Use `data_relationships` for interpreting how tables relate — but avoid SQL joins.
        3. **Determine table relevance**: Identify which tables are needed to answer the question and design queries accordingly.

        SQL Generation Guidelines:
        - Always return standalone queries (one per insight).
        - Avoid JOINs across tables — treat tables independently.
        - Do not reference values from one table in filters of another.
        - Ensure each query is logically distinct and explores a different angle.
        - Do not synthesize or rename columns.
        - All data is stored in TEXT format — always typecast columns explicitly in your SQL based on the schema. You must apply typecasting in SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY clauses wherever numeric or date operations are used.
        - Include WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY where needed.
        - Add LIMIT 100 on non-aggregate queries.
        - Handle NULLs safely in aggregations.
        - Use exact ID matches where filtering is required.
        
        Typecasting Guidelines:
        - You will be given a JSON structure like this:
            ```json
            "schema": {
                "columns": [
                    {
                        "column_name": "age",
                        "prefered_data_type": "INTEGER",
                    },
                    {
                        "column_name": "created_at",
                        "prefered_data_type": "DATE",
                    }
                ]
            }```
        - Treat all columns in the actual database as TEXT. Use the prefered_data_type for each column from schema only to determine their intended types for casting.
        - Apply typecasting explicitly in SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and aggregation clauses.
        - For every column, apply guarded casting using CASE WHEN + regex to avoid SQL runtime errors.
          example: 
          * Integers: CASE WHEN age ~ '^-?\\d+$' THEN age::INTEGER ELSE NULL END AS age
          * Floats / Numerics: CASE WHEN price ~ '^[-+]?\\d*\\.?\\d+$' THEN price::NUMERIC ELSE NULL END AS price
          * Dates: CASE WHEN created_at ~ '^\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}$' THEN created_at::DATE ELSE NULL END AS created_at
          * Booleans: CASE WHEN active IN ('true', 'false') THEN active::BOOLEAN ELSE NULL END AS active
        - Never cast directly without guards (e.g., avoid col::INTEGER unless it is inside a safe CASE WHEN).
    
        Your final output should be 4 SQL queries in JSON format, each with:
        - `"query"`: SQL string
        - `"explanation"`: 1-2 sentence description of what the query does

        Important Notes:
        - Do not refer to internal names like "table_1" — use the file names provided in the schema.
        - Not all queries need full business recommendations or deep analysis.
